bitmap based art table.

## Test
This test covered for application unit tests
```bash
zig build test
```


## Benchmark

### Basic bench
![Basic Benchmark Results](assets/basic_benchmark.png)

Basic performance evaluation measures performance from three perspectives:
- Insert and search performance based on prefix count
- Memory usage trends
- Match rate verification

### Realistic bench
![Realistic Benchmark Results](assets/realistic_benchmark.png)

Production environment evaluation focuses on:
- Relationship between performance and memory usage
- Cache hit rate and match rate trends

### Multithreading bench
![Advanced Benchmark Results](assets/advanced_benchmark.png)

Multithreaded performance evaluation measures:
- Scalability based on thread count
- Impact of memory fragmentation

## Running Benchmarks

To run all benchmark tests:
```bash
make all-bench
```
CSV files and images will be created in `/assets` directory.

To run individual benchmark tests:
```bash
# Basic performance evaluation
zig build bench -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# Production-like performance evaluation
zig build rt_bench -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# Multithreaded performance evaluation
zig build advanced_bench -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

## Setup
`nix develop`

## CGO
