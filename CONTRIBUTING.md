# Contributing to ZART

We welcome contributions to ZART! This document provides guidelines for contributing to ensure high academic and technical standards.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to academic research standards of collaboration, respect, and integrity. By participating, you agree to maintain professional discourse and cite prior work appropriately.

## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gx14ac/zart.git
cd zart

# Install Zig 0.14.1 or later
# Follow: https://ziglang.org/download/

# Run tests to verify setup
zig test src/table.zig
zig test src/concurrent_test.zig

# Run benchmarks
zig build vs-go -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

### Contribution Types

1. **Algorithm Optimizations**: Performance improvements with academic rigor
2. **Concurrent Programming**: Lock-free and parallel algorithm enhancements
3. **Documentation**: Technical documentation and academic references
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage and benchmarking
5. **Bug Fixes**: Issue resolution with regression test inclusion

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Quality Standards

- **Academic Documentation**: All algorithms must include academic references and complexity analysis
- **Performance Focus**: Include benchmarks demonstrating performance characteristics
- **Memory Safety**: All code must be memory-safe and avoid undefined behavior
- **Concurrent Safety**: Thread-safe implementations must be proven correct

#### Code Style

```zig
// Use clear, descriptive function names
pub fn insertOptimizedLPM(self: *Self, prefix: *const Prefix, value: V) void {
    // Academic-style comments explaining algorithm choices
    // Reference: [Paper citation] - algorithm complexity O(log n)
}

// Prefer explicit over implicit
const max_depth: usize = prefix.bits / 8;
const lookup_result: LookupResult(V) = self.lookup(addr);
```

#### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: All public APIs must have comprehensive test coverage
- **Performance Tests**: Include benchmarks comparing with reference implementations
- **Concurrent Tests**: Multi-threaded safety verification
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end scenario testing

### Pull Request Process

1. **Academic Rigor**
   - Include references to relevant academic papers
   - Provide complexity analysis for algorithmic changes
   - Demonstrate performance improvements with benchmarks

2. **Technical Review**
   - Ensure all tests pass: `zig build test`
   - Include performance regression testing
   - Verify concurrent correctness where applicable

3. **Documentation**
   - Update README.md for new features
   - Include inline documentation for complex algorithms
   - Update PERFORMANCE_ACHIEVEMENTS.md for optimizations

### Benchmarking Standards

All performance claims must be substantiated with reproducible benchmarks:

```bash
# Standard benchmark suite
zig build vs-go -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# Advanced profiling
zig build bench -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# Concurrent performance testing
zig test src/concurrent_test.zig -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```
