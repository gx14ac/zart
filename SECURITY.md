# Security Policy

## Academic Security Standards

ZART follows academic security research standards, emphasizing transparency, responsible disclosure, and collaborative improvement of security properties.

## Supported Versions

Currently supported versions for security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Properties

### Memory Safety

ZART leverages Zig's compile-time memory safety guarantees:

- **Buffer Overflow Protection**: Bounds checking in debug and ReleaseSafe modes
- **Use-After-Free Prevention**: Compile-time lifetime analysis
- **Double-Free Protection**: Ownership tracking at compile-time
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Explicit allocation and deallocation patterns

### Concurrent Safety

Multi-threaded safety through formal verification approaches:

- **Data Race Prevention**: Reader-Writer locks and atomic operations
- **Deadlock Avoidance**: Lock ordering and lock-free algorithms where possible
- **ABA Problem Mitigation**: Version numbering in atomic data structures
- **Memory Ordering**: Explicit memory barriers for concurrent operations

### Algorithmic Security

Protection against algorithmic complexity attacks:

- **Worst-Case Complexity Bounds**: O(log n) guaranteed lookup time
- **Hash Flooding Resistance**: Not applicable (tree-based, not hash-based)
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive prefix validation
- **Resource Exhaustion Prevention**: Bounded memory allocation patterns

## Vulnerability Categories

### High Priority

1. **Memory Corruption**: Buffer overflows, use-after-free, double-free
2. **Concurrent Data Races**: Unsynchronized access to shared data
3. **Denial of Service**: Algorithmic complexity attacks
4. **Information Disclosure**: Unintended data exposure

### Medium Priority

1. **Logic Errors**: Incorrect routing decisions
2. **Performance Degradation**: Unexpected algorithmic behavior
3. **Resource Leaks**: Memory or file descriptor leaks

### Low Priority

1. **Documentation Issues**: Misleading security claims
2. **Build System**: Non-security-critical build issues

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Academic Responsible Disclosure

We follow academic principles of responsible disclosure:

1. **Private Reporting**: Email security issues to [security@ZART.org]
2. **Acknowledgment**: 48-hour response confirming receipt
3. **Analysis Period**: 30-90 days for investigation and fix development
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Public disclosure after fix availability
5. **Academic Credit**: Appropriate attribution in security advisories

### Report Format

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing

Continuous security validation:

```bash
# Memory safety testing (AddressSanitizer equivalent)
zig test src/table.zig -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe

# Concurrent safety testing
zig test src/concurrent_test.zig -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe

# Performance regression detection
zig build vs-go -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

### Manual Security Review

Regular security review procedures:

1. **Code Review**: All changes reviewed for security implications
2. **Threat Modeling**: Analysis of potential attack vectors
3. **Penetration Testing**: Controlled security testing
4. **Academic Audit**: External academic security review

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of security protection:

1. **Language-Level Safety**: Zig's compile-time guarantees
2. **Algorithm Design**: Inherently secure data structures
3. **Implementation Practices**: Defensive programming patterns
4. **Testing Validation**: Comprehensive security test coverage

### Secure Defaults

Security-by-default configuration:

- **Memory Safety**: ReleaseSafe mode by default for production
- **Input Validation**: Strict prefix format validation
- **Resource Limits**: Bounded memory allocation
- **Error Handling**: Explicit error propagation

## Security Updates

### Update Process

1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Severity and impact analysis
2. **Fix Development**: Minimum viable fix with comprehensive testing
3. **Security Advisory**: Public disclosure with technical details
